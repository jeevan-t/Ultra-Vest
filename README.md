# Ultra-Vest
This is a project for the Raspberry Pi competition 2021 created by the Tech Phantoms.

The COVID – 19 outbreak has affected many people. The main cause of the fast spreading of this virus is the lack of social distancing among all people. Of course, there are blind people who cannot be certain if there are any people in front of them. We want to help stop this. Therefore we created the Ultra-Vest – to help blind people socially distance. The Ultra-Vest consists of four ultrasonic sensors (each on one side of the person) which will measure distances below 2 metres and send a signal to the attached vibrators to vibrate. This contraption is not only for the blind, but normal people could also use this to make sure that nobody is approaching them from behind. The Ultra-Vest can be used for many other purposes even after the outbreak ends, for example, the Ultra-Vest would alert anybody of pickpockets which would make walking in the streets much safer. Therefore, we believe that the Ultra-Vest will help many people in different situations.
